* Remix IDE (Recommended)

  You will find the link online REMIX IDE below

  [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js)

### Solidity compilation steps:

Look at the below the block diagram:

Source.sol is a solidity file so we store solidity code in the format of (.sol)

The Source file when you hit enter converts into 2 major code

* ABI
* Byte Code
